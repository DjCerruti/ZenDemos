               <h2>Introduction</h2>

           <p>Welcome to this introduction to homeopathy and its practice. Here we'll define homeopathy, present a brief overview of its fascinating history, and introduce you to some of its key principles.</p>

<hr>
           
           <p>Homeopathy is a system of treating illness or disease, as manifested by all the associated symptoms, with substances that produce similar symptoms. It emphasizes treating the patient as a whole, based on his or her own experience, as the patient's most meaningful symptoms are not thought to be some standard observed in the population at large, but actually an expression of the patient's own <q>vital force</q> crying out for help. Symptoms are not thought of as something that must be suppressed, but as information or clues to healing the individual's condition. Key to this process is selecting the substance or remedy that is capable of producing symptoms in healthy individuals similar to the profile of symptoms from which the patient is suffering, and administering that remedy in the <q>minimum dose.</q></p>

           <p>Homeopathy was founded in the 1790s by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician working at at time when standard medical treatment included bloodletting and administering doses of mercury, often resulting in the patient's serious incapacity or ultimate demise. Disenchanted with the often harmful, if not deadly, effects of conventional treatment at the time, Hahnemmann quit his conventional practice and began doing his own research. He had known of a plant called quinine (Peruvian Bark) that could cure patients suffering from malaria and, enquiring into how this was so, began experiments on himself taking frequent small doses of quinine, and soon discovered a startling fact: Quinine produced symptoms of malaria, the same symptoms it was known to cure. Over a number of years he performed hundreds of experiments and found that reducing dosages of harmful substances&mdash;derived from plants, minerals, and even animals&mdash;in dilutions 1 part substance to 10 or 100 parts water/alcohol, succussed, then diluted further, thousands or even millions of times (a process known as "potentization"), gave them profound healing effects on sick individuals suffering the same symptoms those substances were capable of producing in the healthy. This healing principle, the guiding theory of homeopathy, has become popularly known as <q>like cures like.</q></p>

          <p>Homeopathy comprises the following key principles, based on the <cite>Organon of Medicine</cite> by Samuel Hahnemann:</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>A <q>vital force</q> or inner organizing and dynamic principle, governs the overall health of the individual&#46;</li>
                 <li>Disease occurs when some outside influence disturbs the vital force, creating an array of symptoms which represent the true nature of the disease and of the individual's suffering.</li>  
                 <li>Knowledge of the disease must be gained by documenting the <q>totality of symptoms</q> as is revealed in a case study or history of the individual's condition, and cross-referencing those symptoms to a <q>Repertory of the Materia Medica,</q> which lists the substances or remedies which are capable of producing similar symptoms.</li>
                 <li>Knowledge of the remedy must be gained by reference to a <q>Materia Medica,</q> a compendium of plant-, mineral-, and animal-derived remedies and all their effects.</li>
                 <li>The remedy that will initiate a healing response is that one substance capable of producing symptoms most similar to the individual's suffering and symptom profile (i.e., based on <q>like cures like</q>) and administered, with a potency generally commensurate with the state of the vital force, in the least or <q>minimum dose</q> possible to effect a cure.</li>
             </ol>

  <h3>Minimum Dose and Potency</h3>

  <p>The "minimum dose" of a remedy is that least amount necessary to effect a cure of the patient's condition, a concept closely tied to a remedy's <q>potency.</q> In homeopathy what we mean by <q>potency</q> is actually opposite to conventional treatment protocols and what most people would think. In conventional medicine if you want a more potent medicine, you treat with a higher dosage of medicine that contains more of the active medicinal substance. In homeopathy, however, the more dilute the amount of the medicinal substance, the more potent the remedy. In other words, less is more: Less substance &#40;often meaning not even a molecule of the substance is left in the medicine after dilution/succussion&#41; is thought to allow the remedy to penetrate a deeper, energetic level of the human being and "communicate" to the Vital Force the information it needs to galvanize all of the body's resources to initiate a healing response that will overcome the disturbance or illness.</p>

  <p>Remedy potencies are categorized based on the levels of dilution/succussion. One part substance diluted or triturated with 9 parts water or alcohol (or 1 in 10), then succussed (vigorously shaken), is labelled as a 1x potency, then taking 1 part of the 1x solution and diluting it further in 9 parts water or alcohol, then succussing it, results in a second level dilution/succussion labelled as 2x potency, and so on. The following illustrates this process for a higher potency or dilution-succussion level of 1 part substance to 99 parts water or alcohol, or 1 in 100 &#40;in this case, a <q>c</q> potency&#41; the first 4 stages of dilution-succussion resulting successively in 1c, 2c, 3c, and 4c potencies:</p>

  </div>

<div class="floatme">
  <p>The most common potencies are dilution-succussions to the 6th, 12th, 30th, and 200th levels. In the x-potencies, these would be 6x, 12x, 30x, and 200x, and similarly for the c-potencies, 6c, 12c, 30c, and 200c. Following the c-potencies there is a jump to the m-potencies&mdash;1m and 10m, for example, which are dilutions of 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000, respectively. In the m-potencies we are attaining levels that penetrate to a deeper level of the organism, affecting the mind and entire system. A special case are the LM potencies, initial dilutions of 1 in 50,000 or <q>LM1</q>, which may then be further diluted/succussed 1 part of the initial dilution to 99 parts water or alcohol to obtain, in successive dilutions, LM2 through LM30.</p>

  <p>The final diluted solution is used to moisten sugar (generally lactose) globules, which are then administered, 1 or 2 globules, under the tongue (or dissolved in water first, then taken by spoon) for treatment, except that the globules for LM potencies are always dissolved in water and taken by spoon.</p>
