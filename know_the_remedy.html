           <h2>Know the Remedy</h2>

           <p>Once you've identified two, maybe three, strong candidates as a remedy from Kent's or another repertory, you're ready to study those candidates in detail, to learn the <em>their</em> nuances and how their profiles compare to that of the illness or disease. To do that you'll need to obtain a reference known as a "Materia Medica" for homeopathy. The Materia Medica is a compendium of homeopathic remedies, describing hundreds, if not thousands, of remedies &mdash; derived from plant, mineral, and even animal substances &mdash; based on all their observed characteristic and other symptoms, along with their keynotes (central themes or disturbances), as has been demonstrated in tests or "provings" of these remedies' effects on healthy individuals and in clinical practice. Examples of such compendiums include <cite>Materia Medica of Homeopathic Medicines</cite> by Dr. S.R. Phatak and <cite>Concordant Reference</cite> by Frans Vermeulen.</p>
           
           <h3>Remedy Profile</h3>
           <p>The Materia Medica profiles each remedy in two significant ways, through symptom listings and keynotes. Let's take a closer look at each of these.</p>

               <h4>Symptom listings</h4>
               <p>The Materia Medica lists all the observed symptoms of various substances organized, in some accord with the Repertory, under anatomical regions, functions, and general conditions or enjoyments of the body (for example, Mind, Head, Eyes, Vision, Ears, Nose, Stomach, Food & Drink, Abdomen, Rectum, Chest Fever, Chill, Upper, Lower, Sleep, Dreams, Skin, etc.). We'll cover an example later in the section below, <q>Example: Arsenicum and Nux Vomica.</q></p>

               <h4>Keynotes</h4>
               <p>Another major feature of the Materia Medica are the keynotes, or the central themes or disturbances that run throughout the majority of cases and which have been observed in clinical practice. For example, the remedy Cantharis expresses a theme of burning throughout its symptom profile. Therefore, it has such keynotes as burning pain, burning during or around urination, and relief and healing from a severe burn (<cite>Desktop Guide to Keynotes and Confirmatory Symptoms</cite>, by Roger Morrison, M.D.). For an example of how keynotes are used in treatment, see the section below, <q>Example: Arsenicum and Nux Vomica.</q></p>

<aside class="example">
           <h3>Example: Arsenicum and Nux Vomica</h3>
           <p>Let's go back to our example from <q>Know the Condition</q> about Joe Maladi with his stuffed up nose, sleeplessness from worry and overwork, and detail-oriented mind. We found that the remedies Arsenicum (Ars.) and Nux Vomica (Nux-v) ran through most of those symptoms:</p>
             <ul>
               <li>Arsenicum: Nasal obstruction at night, nasal obstruction alternating with discharge, and fastidiousness</li>
               <li>Nux Vomica: Nasal obstruction at night, sleeplessness from active mind, and fastidiousness</li>
             </ul>
               
           <p>While both are good candidates, which is the better one? Recall that those qualities that most distinguish the individual should be given the most importance, such as qualities of mind and general whole-body conditions. Both remedies cover fastidiousness, but Arsenicum covers more of the core physical symptoms of the illness involving the nasal congestion and how it alternates with runny nose discharge, but not the sleeplessnes. While Nux Vomica only covers congestion at night, it also covers sleeplessness from worried mind along with the fastidiousness&mdash;that is, it covers more of the characteristics affecting the person as a whole. While this is practically a tie, and I would lean more toward choosing Nux Vomica, to be sure I would reference the Materia Medica to read more about the <q>personifications</q> of the these two homeopathic medicines.</p>

           <p>Let's take a closer with reference to Frans Vermeulen's Concordant Reference, essentially a comprehensive materia medica, and, assuming we've already confirmed the patient's congestion is covered in the Nose section, his run-down of the Generals and Mind sections for Arsenicum and Nux Vomica (Note: Italics refer to the medicine's keynotes, and the symbols &gt; and &lt; signify <q>better from</q> and <q>worse from</q> respectively.):</p>

           <h3>Arsenicum:</h3>
             <div class="generals">
             <h4>Generals</h4>
             <blockquote class="noborder">
             <p>...debility, exhaustion, and <em>restlessness</em>, with <em>nightly aggravation....Great exhaustion after slightest exertion....Burning pains.</em> Unquenchable thirst. Burning &gt; heat....Odour of discharges is <em>putrid....Septic infections and low vitality....Very restless, &lt; affected part....Increasingly irritable</em> or <em>sudden weakness. Rapid emaciation....Pale, puffy, baggy swelling</em>. Restlessness...at night...throwing himself from side to side...with anxiety....Faintness; when discouraged; & anxiety....Feeling as if pressed by heavy body. Leaden heaviness.</p>
             </blockquote>
             </div>

             <div class="mind">
             <h4>Mind</h4>
             <blockquote class="noborder">
             <p><em>Great anguishness and restlessness</em>....Despair drives him from place to place....Sensitive to disorder and confusion...<em>Oversensitive. Fastidious. Exacting</em>....Ideas crowd upon mind....<em>Full of cares about trifles</em>....Obsessed with <em>order and tidiness....</em>Fretfulness and fault-finding at everything....</p>
              </blockquote>
              </div>

            <h3>Nux Vomica:</h3>
              <div class="generals">
              <h4>Generals</h4>              
              <blockquote class="noborder">
              <p>The typical Nux patient is rather thin, spare, quick, active, nervous, and irritable. He does a good deal of mental work; has mental strains and leads a sedentary life, found in prolonged office work, overstudy, and close application to business, with its cares and anxieties. This indoor life and mental strain leads to use of stimulants, coffee, wine, possibly in excess...if not really a victim to the seductive drugs, like opium, etc. These things are associate with other indulgences...rich and stimulating food...wine and women....Late hours are a consequence; a thick head, dyspepsia, and iritable temper....These conditions produce an <em>irritable</em> nervous system, hypersensitive and overimpressionable....</p>
              </blockquote>
              </div>

              <div class="mind">
              <h4>Mind</h4>
              <blockquote class="noborder">
              <p>Very <em>irritable</em>; sensitive to all impressions....<em>Active, angry and impatient; cant' stand pain;</em> so mad, he cries. <em>Zealous, nervous and excitable</em>....Confusion of mind after vexation....<em>Fastidious. Abundant ideas, clearness of mind, evening in bed</em>....Quarrelsome if disturbed....<em>Obstinately resists wishes of others</em>....</p>
               </blockquote>
               </div>

           <p>While both Mind sections caputure some aspect of the patient's nature&mdash;the fastidiousness, irritability, and oversensitivity&mdash;the Generals section presents some key themes that help distinguish which remedy to choose between the two. Arsenicum's key theme or keynote is weakness, debility, exhaustion, as if the patient were going to drop or faint. Note Nux Vomica's key theme of mental work, overwork, overstudy, and a general sense that the patient has just pushed himself too hard; this seems to fit our patient's situation well, and based on this keynote we would select Nux Vomica as the remedy for treatment.</p>
